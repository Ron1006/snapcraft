🎉 Snapcraft – AI Image Creation App

A UWP-based AI image generation and processing application built for speed, usability, and flexibility.

Snapcraft is a modern UWP application that enables users to generate images using multiple AI models, process outputs, remove backgrounds, convert images to vectors, and use voice-driven input.
The app focuses on delivering a smooth user experience, strong API integration, and modular architecture across all features.

🚀 Features Overview
🎨 1. Multi-Model AI Image Generation

Snapcraft integrates multiple AI models (e.g., Realistic, Animation, Live3D).
Each model uses its own API endpoint, allowing:

Dynamic switching between models

Flexible scaling when adding new models

Clean modularity via enum/switch-case management

The UI updates visually when a model is selected, giving users clear confirmation of their active generation mode.

🔗 2. Robust API Integration & Error Handling

API endpoints are called dynamically based on user selection

Missing or invalid API tokens trigger user-friendly error messages

Asynchronous calls ensure the UI remains responsive

Fail-safes maintain stability even with network or model errors

This makes the application reliable and production-ready.

🖼️ 3. Image Processing & Cross-Feature Interactions

Once images are generated, they appear in a grid. Users can:

Tap an image to open PicDetail

Expand it

Remove background

Convert it to vector format

Pass the same image into other modules seamlessly

This unified workflow creates a smooth, cohesive editing experience.

🎤 4. Voice Input with Speech Recognition

Snapcraft includes speech-to-text prompt input, allowing users to generate images using just their voice.

Continuous listening mode

Updates prompt textbox in real time

Full async implementation

Error handling for recognition failures

Voice toggle button with UI feedback

This accessibility feature enables hands-free creativity.

🧭 5. Intuitive Navigation & UI/UX Management

Using UWP’s built-in Frame navigation model, the app supports:

Navigation between pages such as:
MainPage → PicDetail → BackgroundRemoval → ImageToVectors

NavigationCacheMode.Required for improved performance

State preservation when returning to previous pages

Show/hide panels for size & style selection

Visual button feedback for improved usability

The result is a modern, responsive UI experience.

⚙️ 6. Size Selection & Output Customization

Users can select output dimensions (e.g., 512×512, 4:3, 16:9).
The chosen size is:

Displayed instantly in the UI

Passed into the AI generation endpoint

Used to maintain consistency across different models

🧠 7. Advanced Input Handling for UX

Snapcraft supports both:

Manual input

Voice-driven commands

Error-resistant handlers and immediate UI response ensure:

Stable operations

Clear user feedback

Minimal frustration even in bad input scenarios
